# N Body Solar System Simulation

This was the personal project I did for my Scientific Computing course in 2021. I wanted to simulate the N-body problem, predicting how celestial objects move and interact with each other via the force of gravity. 

## The Math 

We can predict the orbital motions of these objects by determining their instantaneous positions and velocities at any given time from their interactive forces. 

The gravitational force of attraction between to planets is the net force causing a planet to orbit around a source planet. Using Newton's first law, we can use the gravitational force to determine the acceleration the orbiting planet experiences at any given time. From the acceleration, we can obtain the instantaneous velocity and position of the planet, to plot its orbit. 

The gravitational force between two objects is given by:

$F_g = \frac{G{m_s}{m_o}}{r^2}$

Subbing this in to Newton's first law: 

$F_g = ma$ 

$\frac{G{m_s}{m_o}}{r^2} = {m_o}{a_o}$ 

Note that the left hand side acceleration, $a_o$, is associated with the orbiting mass, $m_o$. Now simplifying, 

$a_o = \frac{G{m_s}}{r^2}$

We see that the accleration of the orbiting planet now only depends on the mass of the source planet, the gravitational constant, and the square of the distance between them. 

We can now solve for the velocity and position of the orbiting planet at a given instant. As acceleration is the first derivaâ€ ive of velocity, we can substitute this in the equation to get: 

$/frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{G{m_s}}{{r_x}^2}$

$/frac{dv_y}{dt} = \frac{G{m_s}}{{r_y}^2}$
