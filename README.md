# N Body Solar System Simulation

This was the personal project I did for my Scientific Computing course in 2021. I wanted to simulate the N-body problem, predicting how celestial objects move and interact with each other via the force of gravity. We can predict the orbital motions of these objects by calculating their instantaneous positions and velocities at any given time from their interactive forces. 

## The Math 

To plot each planet's orbit, we needed the instantaneous $x$ and $y$ velocities and $x$ and $y$ positions. These equations were obtained using Newton's first law and law of universal gravitation.  

The gravitational force of attraction between two plants is the net force that causes a planet to orbit a source planet. Setting Netwon's first law and law of universal gravitation equal to each other, we obtain:

F = ma $\newline$
$\frac{G{m_s}{m_o}}{r^2} = {m_o}a \\ $
